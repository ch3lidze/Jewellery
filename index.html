            Amanda is a Brazilian fashion designer based in Miami. From an early age she was interested in the arts and manual tasks and her favorite activity was always drawing, which she loves to do until the present days. For Amanda, few things are more pleasurable than seeing an idea become material and enter people's lives, creating bonds between those who create and those who wear it.
